We have used Dream Booth to generate stylized shield game assets using a database of 10 shields which we have retrieved from the unity asset store. Below are some of the images we have managed to generate using the “Euler a” sampling method. 

    The stable diffusion model was trained on a series of shields which had captions. We had created a custom keyword: “Loebla” as a refence to the word shield and these has resulted in working very well.
